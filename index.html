  <p>I grew up in Los Angeles.</p>
  <p>I studied computer science at Johns Hopkins University, and participated in clubs, including my senior year as president of the John Hopkins Outdoors Club (JHOC). 
  <p>I worked at Seesaw, a K-5 edtech startup in San Francisco, for three years. While at Seesaw, I worked on Seesaw's Android app as a full stack software engineer using Java and Kotlin. 
  <p>I left Seesaw to work on Snowball Wealth, a fintech startup founded by experienced entrepreneurs Pam Martinez and Tanya Menendez. I currently work at Snowball Wealth as a Lead Software Engineer handling Python, Django, and our mobile app's backend. 
  <p>I'm looking for my next role! If you're looking for a savvy tech lead for your startup, reach out at [Elana's email].
